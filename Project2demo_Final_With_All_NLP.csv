"matti fatti","Mrs Stella Steven","excellent","three july twothousandtwentyfour","absolutely not genuine advertised flights at good prices on comparison site when you try to book shows as no seats available it then drops down to show you which flights are available good i thought similar flight times same price but same thing again no seats available they then contacted me as vie entered all of my contact and credit card details the spiel then begins business light fare no longer available on of the legs i then say i font need to travel at and can choose one of the later flights which are still available immediately mi told that none of the st legs are available really he dint even have time to check he then offers me a stand by business fare which i may or may not get and i wont know until BA update their prices and that could be on the day of travel questioned this and asked what would happen then if it hadn't been confirmed and he said that if it did happen it may be possible to pay to upgrade on the day at the airport but it would be a lot more expensive than booking a business standard directly with them now he could not even tell me what class i would be traveling on or if i would be able to travel at all i asked if the stand by only applied to the st leg only that apparently was not available it dint it applied to the whole journey he also stressed that the stand by fare was non returnable how absurd he expected me to pay in excess of k for a stand by business fare without even knowing if i would be able to travel or in what class for all i know they could have booked me onto a standard ticket costing less than half of what id paid them and id have absolutely no comeback out of curiosity i asked him how much the standard fare would be i knew as i had the BA website open he then quoted me a higher rate than was available on BA for exactly the same flight when i questioned this he once again claimed that this fare would not be available if i attempted to proceed to payment on BA it was and contrary to what he told me the old spiel only seats left i would have been able to book at least seats directly with BA so the flight clearly does not only have seats leftist half empty i asked him why they advertised so many fares at such a reduced rates when according to them none are available only then for them to try and scam scare people by claiming only seats left and attempting to charge them a higher fare than the airline no response except that he told if i had booked hour before i would have got the cheaper fare as it had been available apparently a couple booked the last business light seats on exactly the same route we had attempted to book what a coincidence a last minute booking on a not too popular route and another couple from Glasgow book exactly the same flight on the same day yeah sure especially when the flight clearly still half empty according to him he attempted to get me the discounted fare when he saw i was having none of his nonsense he said his boss was going to check with BA and see if they had released their stand by rates and that he would call me back still no call and not expecting one they clearly have an arrangement with BA where they sell their flights for them for commission but they have become so greedy that they attempt to trick the public into paying more and sadly for them they failed to dupe me and on this occasion they missed out on a sale be aware that their prices are a ruse to entice you once they have your details they will call you and spin you a yarn then try to overcharge you do your homework before attempting to book with them historically they were OK now there nothing more than NA never received a call back regarding an updated price which i was told would happen shortly after i ended the call yesterday at i did however receive a call at who would call any customer at that time of night funnily enough the first thing they mentioned was that they wanted to discuss the trust pilot review not a mention of a new price or the BS id been subjected earlier in the day can only assume that they were attempting to stop my review being published as it appears that when anyone creates a review the company can view it beforehand i told them to call me back in the morning its now and still nothing out of curiosity i checked their prices on kayak this morning and surprise surprise the flight that i had attempted to book was still available but at an even cheaper price than yesterday with crystal travel so i decided to phone them up and ask if it was available not a hope in hell once again they were even more expensive than bi actually feel sorry for their staff who are clearly very badly trained as they are unable to provide savvy customers with a plausible reason for the variances in fares advertised v offered v airline fare poor"

"Zella H.","Sketchy Experience","below average","Twenty-seven December Two-thousand-twenty-three","Thankfully we were only booking flights to Amsterdam less than £200, anything more expensive and I would've been very uncomfortable!I received a call to make our booking, despite trying to do it online. Our handler was a chap called ""Ronnie O'Connor"" despite having a thick Indian accent, which feels dishonest. His English level was poor and he barked instructions at us which we were struggling to understand, which isn't a reassuring situation when there's money involved.He then sent us an email link to a 3rd party payment site. Again, not sure why I wasn't allowed to go through the booking process online like any other travel company. We were both very skeptical about the process and how unprofessional it had been.Thankfully our tickets were real and we went on our holiday, but I definitely won't be using them again for the sake of saving a few quid.

"Isobel Scarlette","TOTAL FIX!","bad","Eighteen November Two-thousand-twenty-four","One star is generous! Customer service Paul is rude and obnoxious whom constantly speaks over customers. This company advertises the lowest price throughout the entire day to undercut other 3rd party agents. Once booked the payment will not go through as the promotional offer has ""expired"". This will not reflect or update on the website, as they want customer details. Once details have been maintained they will contact you with the ""best price"" which will be more than other providers and potentially the airlines. Avoid at all costs! This is a scam and improper use of fair trading! They should be ashamed of themselves."

"Peter","Trying to con the public with ""dynamic pricing""","below average","Five November Two-thousand-twenty-four","Advertised two business class flights Heathrow to Cape Town for a total of £3089. When booking flights, right at the end the payment was ""declined"". The agent phoned me and informed me that the flights as advertised were unavailable due to ""dynamic pricing issues"". The price I was then offered was £4750 for the two tickets, or £4064 for flying the day before. This was clearly an attempt to fool the customer into accepting the day earlier flight, which was over £900 more than the advertised flight. It is obvious from previous reviewers that this is a common practice. While discussing this with the agent, I opened a separate window on the laptop and  sourced the flights on the day I wanted to fly directly through the airline for £3500. Although this was more than the advertised price, it was still over £500 less than this outfit tried to con me out of.Update 7/11/24A supervisor and manager both contacted me yesterday to apologise for incorrect information supplied by the booking agent, and additional training would be provided for the particular agent who dealt with the request. The manager indicated that I could be offered the flights for nearly the price originally indicated on the website. This would entail cancelling the booking with the airline and incurring cancellation charges which, ultimately, would not result in any savings. I have been offered a £100 discount voucher, valid for 6 months, as an apology. Based on these interactions, I have raised the rating from 1 to 2 and will give the company another look when booking my next flights. While it is appreciated that the team has reached out to address the issue, the end result is me having to pay more for the flights, through a different provider, than was advertised.  The rating is based on the satisfaction with the desired outcome i.e. the purchase of the air tickets at the price advertised. Unfortunately the response after the event, no matter how good, has little bearing on not meeting the expectation."

This time, I had the pleasure of working with Claire, and from start to finish, she was incredibly helpful. She took the time to thoroughly research different options, even when I had to reject some of them. Claire never gave up and consistently returned with well-considered alternatives for flights and timings. She asked thoughtful questions to ensure she had all the necessary information to offer the best options. Knowing I’ll be traveling with a 1-year-old, she carefully considered the challenges we might face, such as long layovers.What I thought would be a stressful process—booking a multi-city trip—turned out to be seamless, thanks to Claire. She took all the difficulty out of it and made the entire experience smooth and stress-free.Once again, thank you Crystal Travel and thank you, Claire, for all your help!"

I admit I was irritated to hear that I was not guaranteed to sit next to my wife and daughter on a long haul flight that also included transfers. Even the poor airlines give you the option to choose your seating as you book albeit for an additional cost, but they are transparent. I assumed we would be and wasn't asked. Wrongly I assumed  that a reputable airline like emirates would do this as standard especially for long haul flights. Having to take a call after paying for the flights in full and highlighting this to me felt underhanded and having to pay an additional £250 for 3 seats to ensure we sat next to each other was frustrating. On a  positive note we now have are guaranteed seats for all 4 flights so we wont have any difficult conversations when we check in. But the prices are very competitive and the speed and efficiency of the booking and follow up is excellent.Rob Neill"

"Michael","Not happy at all - AVOID","bad","Twenty-six August Two-thousand-twenty-four","Not happy at all. I was booking via the website, a business class flight. I book a lot of flights so I am aware of how these things work. I had to take a call mid-booking and received a phone call from Crystal Travel. The chap stated that my flight was only part business class - the website stated it was business class on all legs. Wanted me to book with him over the phone - is this a commission scam? I didn’t like that. If their website state’s business class but only gives ‘half’ the journey as business then this is advertising by false pretences. Either way I chose Booking.com to do my flight - I just didn’t feel I could trust Crystal at all after this. So I will avoid permanently. Follow up! ! Day later. I received a call apologising for the sales rep. Which wasn’t surprising but very welcomed, Vikram explained that my experience is not their normal service. I was offered a £100 voucher of a future flight but that’s when I feel it went downhill, as I was then asked to change my initial rating of 1*. I also felt it was difficult ending the call I made it clear two or three times I was done, but the insistence by Vikram to carry on talking may have made someone more easily coerced into feeling they had to change that rating. The goodwill that was initially created from this call evaporated with that heavily suggested request. I also feel that having read so many comments from other potential/customers all saying this experience isn’t unique - this practice is EXTREMELY common place and is an acceptable form of behaviour from all the reps. I haven’t changed my rating - because I believe they only called because of the less than favourable but truthful experience and review I left. Also after reading so may other reviews I wouldn’t trust them to inflate the price of anything I booked with them by the £100 they said they’d discount me so the voucher would be ‘costed’ into any future flight. So I still recommend using someone else and avoiding Crystal Travel."

"Emily","Reliable support and well priced tickets!","excellent","Twenty-six June Two-thousand-twenty-four","I was booking travel to South Korea for a summer programme, and being a student I was looking to save money on flights so I could have more for spending while I was over there. I found Crystal Travel through Skyscanner and the prices looked too good to be true, which usually means it is, however my experience couldn't be more the opposite. I got a call the morning after I booked them where I had the pleasure of being handled by Stella, she was wonderful and very patient as she explained everything I needed to know or was confused about, and even hung on the line as I coordinated seat plans with my friend who had booked the same flights as I did. Very lovely and kind!It was easy to collect the tickets at the airport, I just printed the boarding pass I was emailed, and continued with check in at the desks as I would if I had booked with Tui. I had no problems whatsoever with any of the flights (and as I took six flights in total, 3 there and 3 return, this is a huge feat) My only, really minor, complaint is that perhaps they pushed the 'give us a 5 star review' thing a little too much, and as I prefer to wait until after I experience something to review it, and I felt bad for waiting this time. But again, it is such a minor thing and ultimately I do really recommend Crystal Travel. It's quick, easy and reliable!"

Although informed i still missed the return flight and had to buy another ticket. Although the fault was mine I was told I could reclaim the airport taxes (paid twice although used once). The airline said this was up to the travel agent. After phone calls and emails Thomas said he would look into it and call back the following month. He did not and i also had no response to my follow up email. What is the point of booking through an agent and paying them their commissions if they do not act for their customers? When someone says he will phone back and does not then he lies and cannot be trusted.On other points:1. The prices on Crystal Travel website were out-of-date at time of phoning and prices were generally a couple hundred £ more expensive than advertised. 2. Although I received email for ticket I did not receive a receipt for the most expensive ticket I have purchased.I had previously booked flights with Crystal Travel but never again.I very much hope that potential customers look elsewhere."

Cheap Flights should be banning these companies from doing this because I know I’ll never use them again and I’ll stick with Skyscanner. Never an issue in 10 years with them.

"ABre","Absolute Scam - Avoid For Less Hassle","bad","Fifteen July Two-thousand-twenty-four","Absolute Scam. Comparison sites need to closely review these companies as each 'cheapest' option flights are like this one. My bank thought the payment was fraudulent and once resolved I phoned to get Crystal Travel to send me a link so I can try again. 'Ronan' spent 5 minutes ""checking the fare"" to see if it was available. Once I pressed to hurry up, he told me that it's coming up as nearly £100 more per person than my 'saved' booking. This is more expensive than the airline direct and when I searched the flight ON THEIR OWN WEBSITE, his quote was £50 more than that! He tried to tell me these flights get booked up and the 'basic' package I selected was not available. I proved it clearly was and he went on about flights changing, which all searches for these flights I've done have not seen the price increase so much so quickly! This tactic is something I read on other reviews of websites like them that put me off (FlightCatcher.com & SkyWings.com). The reviews on Crystal Travel are deceiving and I would bet they are all the same company with the same call centre too!I wonder if I used a Debit Card the payment would have worked first time but they no doubt would have found ways to increase my spend. I thought it was sketchy that ATOL protection was an add on... Likely going to go direct to the airline now, rather than deal with scammers like this. But do not use them, even if the price is tempting!"

He was very nice and friendly.They did advertise lower, but with baggage it was $100 extra per bag. They still were a lot cheaper than all the other airlines. After I read their reviews, I was very nervous that our seats would be resold. I called Mr. White and he assured me everything would be fine. Another travel professional told me that they just don’t let any company into the airlines database. One needs to be licensed. And Scionn said they operate honestly or else they would lose their license which I do believe.We had no problems with our seats we bought from Crystal Travel. I would have given them 5 stars, but they were unable to give us their advertised price. They called us and upsold us.If you need 100% piece of mind, go through the airlines and book early and get travel insurance."
"Consumer","A middle man with no customer service","bad","Ten July Two-thousand-twenty-four","Crystal travel are a middle man with no customer service to speak of and no actual ability to manage your travel other than to simply make the original booking. Flight was cancelled, crystal travel didn’t let us know, we only found out when we tried to check in. We had been booked onto a flight the next day without being consulted or told. We then spent 6 hours on hold / on calls with crystal travel who were totally unable to do anything for us despite repeatedly promising that they would. The call centre operatives were robotic and unhelpful, always taking longer than they told us to get back to us. When we got through to the supervisor he was more human but although he offered us two alternative flights, he wasn’t actually able to book either of them, so both times had to offer it to us then tell us it wasn’t actually possible. The result was that after 6 hours we were still booked onto the same flight as before."

"J the Traveller","Absolutely Not Genuine - Update","bad","Three July Two-thousand-twenty-four","Absolutely Not GenuineAdvertised flights at good prices on comparison site. When you try to book shows as no seats available - it then drops down to show you which flights are available. Good I thought, similar flight times same price - but same thing again, no seats available.They then contacted me as I've entered all of my contact / and credit card details. The spiel then begins - Business Light fare no longer available on 1 of the 6 legs. I then say I don't need to travel at 07:05 and can choose one of the later flights which are still available - immediately I'm told that none of the 1st legs are available - really, he didn't even have time to check. He then offers me a Stand By Business fare which I may or may not get and I won't know until BA update their prices and that could be on the day of travel..I questioned this and asked what would happen then if it hadn't been confirmed - and he said that if it did happen it may be possible to pay to Upgrade on the day at the airport but it would be a lot more expensive than booking a Business Standard directly with them now!! He could not even tell me what class I would be travelling on - or if I would be able to travel at all. I asked if the Stand By only applied to the 1st leg only ( that apparently was not available) - it didn't, it applied to the whole journey!!He also stressed that the Stand By Fare was non returnable. How absurd. He expected me to pay in excess of £4.4k for a Stand By Business fare without even knowing if I would be able to travel or in what class - for all I know they could have booked me onto a Standard ticket costing less than half of what I'd paid them and I'd have absolutely no comeback.  Out of curiosity I asked him how much the 'Standard Fare' would be - I knew as I had the BA website open - he then quoted me a higher rate than was available on BA for exactly the same flight - when I questioned this he once again claimed that this fare would not be available if I attempted to proceed to payment on BA - it was and contrary to what he told me - the old spiel only 2 seats left - I would have been able to book at least 9 seats directly with BA - so the flight clearly does not only have 2 seats left...its half empty. I asked him why they advertised so many fares at such a reduced rates when according to them none are available; only then for them to try and scam/scare people by claiming only 2 seats left and attempting to charge them a higher fare than the airline. No response except that he told if I had  booked 1 hour before I would have got the cheaper fare as it had been available - apparently a couple booked the last 2 Business Light seats on exactly the same route we had attempted to book - what a coincidence, a last minute booking on a not too popular route and another couple from Glasgow book exactly the same flight on the same day - yeah sure, especially when the flight clearly still half empty, According to him he attempted to get me the discounted fare - when he saw I was having none of his nonsense. He said his boss was going to 'check' with BA and see if they had released their Stand By rates and that he would call me back - still no call and not expecting one. They clearly have an arrangement with BA where they sell their flights for them for commision - but they have become so greedy that they attempt to trick the public into paying more and sadly for them they failed to dupe me and on this occasion they missed out on a sale.  BE AWARE THAT THEIR PRICES ARE A RUSE TO ENTICE YOU - ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR DETAILS THEY WILL CALL YOU AND SPIN YOU A YARN THEN TRY TO OVERCHARGE YOU..DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO BOOK WITH THEM - HISTORICALLY THEY WERE OK NOW THEY'RE NOTHING MORE THAN SCAMMERSUpdate:-I never received a call back regarding an updated price - which I was told would happen shortly after I ended the call yesterday at 15:00. I did however receive a call at 23:00 - who would call any customer at that time of night? Funnily enough the first thing they mentioned was that they wanted to discuss the Trust Pilot review - not a mention of a new price or the BS I'd been subjected earlier in the day.I can only assume that they were attempting to stop my review being published - as it appears that when anyone creates a review the 'Company' can view it beforehand. I told them to call me back in the morning - it's now 13:57 and still nothing.Out of curiosity I checked their prices on Kayak this morning and surprise surprise the flight that I had attempted to book was still available but at an even cheaper price than yesterday with Crystal Travel - so I decided to phone them up and ask if it was available - not a hope in hell. Once again they were even more expensive than BA.I actually feel sorry for their staff, who are clearly very badly trained, as they are unable to provide savvy customers with a plausible reason for the variances in fares advertised v offered v airline fare - Poor"

"Navin Parmar","Flights to India","excellent","Nineteen June Two-thousand-twenty-four","We recently booked flights through Crystal Travel with the advisor Ana Swift. initially we made enquiries about travel from Birmingham to Delhi. Ana was able to secure us a good deal for 4 passengers.when we said we needed open tickets she said that we would be able to change our return ticket and pay the difference.we then explained that our return flight would be from elsewhere.Ana said that would be no problem.In the end she arranged our two internal flights as we were not aware that lnternal flights would charge us heavily for our baggage, she even managed to book 3 passengers from Goa to Heathrow via delhi and one passenger from Surat to Heathrow via Delhi. It was a difficult task and with the help of her expertise, know how and dediction to get us all our flights to the correct airports with the correct baggage allowance, she did a brilliant job. She was calm and professional throughout despite having to make many changes. i think if we had anyone else they would not have persevered with our difficult request as they would have found it too much work."

Oh, I clean forgot, I must have phoned a Crystal Travel on the Moon, and spoken to a ghost called David there. Truly unbelievable !And you, TrustPilot have now proved to be so complicit hand-in-glove with this Travel Agency playing to their tune trying to get me to give them all my details just so that they can get a favourable Review !!Talk about being partial to businesses !! Absolutely diabolical and hypocritical by TrustPilot. Okay, because I will not cave in and bow to your veiled threats, TrustPilot, go ahead and take off the Review, as you threaten. Let the public then decide whose side TrustPilots takes!!REPLY To Crystal Travel. As I only made a tentative phone inquiry and spoke to your David, whose answers/excuses specially re: extra hold baggage seeing how others here have been so effusive, then made me curtail the call.  So there is no Reference, or whatever else you seek. It was only a phone call inquiry. End of the subject as far as I am concerned!@Crystal Travel. Sorry, not the faintest chance I will be divulging anything personal such as contact number, email address, etc. As I have already stated, it was a tentative Inquiry. End of the matter.

In April I missed my flight to an important wedding happening in the next two days. I almost thought I would never be there. Frank worked tirelessly and managed to get me a flight that got me on time. I am very grateful for the travelling experience I always get. It is such a good feeling to know that whenever I need to travel there’s someone such as Frank to expertly take care of the arrangements."

"Justin Tate","A bunch of scammers","bad","Twenty-four June Two-thousand-twenty-four","I had read the other negative reviews on TrustPilot, but decided to give Crystal Travel a try anyway for return flights from Southampton to Antananarivo (via Amsterdam and Nairobi), since they were offering the lowest prices on Kayak. I completed the booking on their website and paid. I then received a message on their website:""Booking Declined - Your booking has been declined due to dynamic changes with the availability of seats of selected airline.Please contact our customer care on – 0207 612 0500 or e-mail at customercare@crystaltravel... to book your flight.Note: Fares are subject to availability of seats and it cannot be guaranteed till the ticket is issued.""I phoned Crystal Travel, who after transferring me to various colleagues and putting me on hold several times, informed me that my booking had been declined as on one leg all economy seats were already sold, but they had spoken to the airline concerned and they could get me a good price on a business class ticket on the leg concerned, but that would add over a £1000 to our total ticket prices. I declined and checked another travel against who were able to sell me the tickets that I wanted.It seems, like others say, that Crystal Travel offer low flight prices to get potential customers involved, but then say there is an issue and try to heavily upsell unnecessary products based on inaccurate information. They deserve their poor reviews.17/7/24 - Update - following Crystal Travel's response below to my review, I also received an email from them asking for a phone number so they could contact me to discuss my 'experience' dealing with them. I provided it but never heard back from them."

Book a flight, tell you it’s cancelled and another flight needs booking, which ends up being a lot more than the quote. Can’t even use their real names when call them or on their email references- this should be a huge red flag. Crystal travel said they can only make amendments on the same day, yet when I called airline they say they company has 7 days to make amendments, but the company had to do it as they were the customer. They gave me flights to Arizona from London via 2hrs in Boston.. but only mentions after paying that the arrival and departing in Boston were in different airports.. 1hr away. They knew I’d never make this, but I see the plan is “sell them sh**, charge them again for correction”. The guy I spoke to sounds like he loves himself.. I’d love to meet him in person, see then how mouthy and cocky he is. Stay away from these clowns"

"Consumer","Do not use Crystal Travel","bad","Thirty April Two-thousand-twenty-four","Crystal travel are very friendly and efficient when you are purchasing flight tickets which I did. But, once there are any issues it becomes a nightmare dealing with them. I requested a flight delay compensation from Crystal Travel as I had booked flights only with BA through them. I have been dealing with this issue since the end of April, I have made numerous phone calls and over 12 emails and the issue still hasn’t been resolved, and it’s now the middle of June. Their incompetence and lack of customer service is appalling. They are now saying it should be BA that should compensate me even though BA have stated to me they have processed the compensation payment to Crystal travel and they have to process the compensation back to me. I have wasted hours of my time on emails, phone calls and chasing them. I am absolutely appalled by this company.Update I also sent a complaint email to Japial Singh( Director) and have not received an acknowledgment or any correspondence from him. I spoke to Kapil (manager)today who still could not resolve the issue and when I asked to speak to Jaipal I was told that he doesn’t speak to customers. This shows a total lack of understanding as I am waiting got flight delay compensation of over £1000. I will be contacting the CEO Mr S Kang with all the relevant information. I have also asked for compensation in relation to the incredibly terrible customer service, but unsurprisingly I am still waiting on that as wellI repeat do not use this travel agent, especially for just flights as I truly regret not purchasing directly from BA."

Turns out that the way they book the ticket is in a fare class that is not available once you change the ticket. They admitted this to me once I asked them to find any date in the future that would not occur an additional fee. When I tried to move the flight to a day earlier the final price should not have changed because the tickets had not gone up in the meantime, but they charged me a substantial amount and much more than the airline would have charged if I had just booked a flexible ticket directly. Dishonest marketing of flexible tickets - beware if that is what you’re looking for.EDIT: the team at Crystal Travel followed up with me multiple times to improve the situation and ended up refunding over half of the increased cost."

I didn't let it rest and asked for an escalation. It did cost around £800 more, however, in comparison with other providers this was very reasonable. The supervisory/management team of Jazz and Vikram were extremely helpful in ensuring I got the best price possible and maintained communications until I was fully booked. The only issue I have was the online price, the staff after this were excellent and patient with a rather perturbed customer (myself). If not for the inability of the site to maintain accurate sales prices I would have given 5 stars. I did communicate with another couple of companies and have to say that Crystal Travel was of a much higher standard and I felt more comfortable and trusting when dealing with them. Thank you to Jazz and Vikram for your patience and assistance throughout."
